## EXPERIMENTAL STUFF

1. MatchZoo trainers should be working or almost working. However, they were not recently tested.
2. Training data for MatchZoo can be generated using ``scripts/export_train/export_matchzoo.sh``.
   However, we could not get good results with MatchZoo on TREC MSMARCO and further
   testing was abandoned.
